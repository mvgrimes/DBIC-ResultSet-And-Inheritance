This is an example of inheriting from a DBIx::Class Result Class, and the 
impacts on the ResultSet Classes from doing so. When the test is run the
load_namespaces produces the following message:


	DBIx::Class::Schema::load_namespaces(): We found ResultSet class
	'Schema::Test:: ResultSet::ProductChild2' for 'ProductChild2', but it seems
	that you had already set 'ProductChild2' to use
	'Schema::Test::ResultSet::ProductParent' instead at
	/Users/mgrimes/src/websites/kci/tmp/dbic-inheritance/lib/Schema/Test.pm
	line 7

	DBIx::Class::Schema::load_namespaces(): We found ResultSet class
	'Schema::Test:: ResultSet::ProductChild' for 'ProductChild', but it seems
	that you had already s et 'ProductChild' to use
	'Schema::Test::ResultSet::ProductParent' instead at
	/Users/mgrimes/src/websites/kci/tmp/dbic-inheritance/lib/Schema/Test.pm
	line 7


This was tested with:
	Perl - 5.10.1
	DBIx::Class  - 0.08127 and 0.08191
	Moose  - 1.17
